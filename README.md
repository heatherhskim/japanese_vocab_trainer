# japanese_vocab_trainer
Learning Japanese vocab has been tough, so I started building a simple vocab review app over the summer. Still in its early stages—more features coming soon!

# JLPT Vocab Trainer

I'm currently studying for the JLPT over summer break, and memorizing vocabulary has been tough.  
So I decided to create my own simple vocab trainer!  
This project is still a work in progress, and I plan to keep improving it step by step.

## 📌 Features
- Load vocab files by JLPT level (N1~N5)
- Ask if you know the word
- Show definitions for unknown words
- Repeat only unknown words until mastered

## 🛠️ To Do
- Add scoring system
- Improve UI (eventually make into an iOS app)
- Organize unknown vocab into a file

## 🗓️ Dev Log
I’m using this repo to keep track of my progress and motivation during the summer 🌞
